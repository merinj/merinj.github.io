title: My experience at Bloc
---
This post is about the experience I am having at Bloc till now. I always get excited when I see good website.

A good website, for me should be user friendly and attractive.The curriculum of Bloc is vast and very advanced with current technologies that industry uses.
I think this gives an edge to the student finishing the frond end course.I am having a pleasent experience with the course.Whenever I have bottlenecks my mentor will help me to figure it out and explains in a way I understands.
