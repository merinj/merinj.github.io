title : Biggest Challenge
---

Bloc Jams is written using both Vanilla JS,JQuery and in Angular JS. The quick transition to the Angular was a challenging situation for me. 
Anglar JS was new to me and  it took me some time to understand it.I read a lot about it,watched some webcast and asked my mentor too. I like Angular because it gave a  structured look to the project and it's clean.
Since i'm learning new things evryday, I put comments for  main codes so that I understand it quickly,when I check it again.
